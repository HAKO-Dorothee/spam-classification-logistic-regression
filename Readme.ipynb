    "# üìß Spam Classification using Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses **logistic regression** to predict whether an email is spam or not, based on the [Spambase dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase). It is a complete machine learning pipeline built in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Objective\n",
    "Build a **binary classification model** to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails using supervised learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìÅ Dataset\n",
    "- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository\n",
    "- Number of samples: 4,601 emails\n",
    "- Number of features: 57\n",
    "- Target: \n",
    "  - `1` ‚Üí Spam  \n",
    "  - `0` ‚Üí Not Spam\n",

    "## üìä Process Overview\n",
    "1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Normalization\n",
    "   - Check for missing values\n",
    "   - Train-test split (70/30)\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "   - Boxplots for outlier detection\n",
    "   - Correlation matrix and heatmap\n",
    "   - Class distribution\n",
